TODO:

- Fix shadow ray through transparent object.
|-> For now it’s working. The idea is, if the shadow ray does not reach any lights
|   it would normally mean it’s necessary to cast a shadow. Now, if that happens 
|   I proceed to check if the objects in the way are transparent. If they are,
|   then I still calculate the diffusive and specular components of the light
|   but they are attenuated by a certain amount.
|-> For now the solution is not so good regarding code, both the functions
|   lightsReached and lightsReachedThroughTransparency are essentially the same.
|   Needs a better way to deal with that.
|-> For the the value of attenuation is a hard coded 0.8. Maybe a better value to
|   use would be the Kt value of the object in the light’s way (in this case what
|   happens if here are more than one? who knows, consider that).

- Fix Kd-tree traversal, when trying with the full stanford bunny it breaks.
|-> Also breaking with res4
|-> After running the bunny without the kd-tree I get the same feedback, maybe
    the error is reading the triangles and not the kd-tree…

- Maybe change the ray marching stuff, like spawnRayMarch, which is mainly on
  world.h to a new file just for that. Possibly a new ‘project’ altogether.
